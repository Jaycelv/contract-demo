### Team members
    Jaycelv

### Project Overview
I tried to use the official library to create a demo, wrote a front-end page, an ERC20 smart contract, a cross-chain bridge smart contract, to enable transactions between the OP and Base chains.
### Run-book
1. Install dependens, compile, deploy
```
just install 
npx hardhat compile
just deploy optimism base
```
2. You will get 2 contract addresses as port address


### PortAddress
Op: 0x4e228D691c5A5608EF05666924F9bC49a933D41F
Base: 0x3Ab9640a577331afb5df06EDbb09Da517a072be1
